#  Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Machine Learning Projects** built during my internship at *Elevvo Institute* and my personal learning journey.

Each task explores a different ML concept such as data preprocessing, regression, model evaluation, and experimentation — using real-world datasets and hands-on Python code.

##  Included Projects

###  Task 1: Student Exam Score Prediction

> Predict student exam scores using various academic and lifestyle features.

**Key Highlights:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning (missing values, object to numeric)
- Label Encoding
- Linear Regression & Polynomial Regression
- Model Evaluation (MAE, MSE, R² Score)
- Bonus: Feature engineering & performance comparison

### Task 2: Mall Customer Segmentation
> Cluster mall customers into distinct segments based on their annual income and spending score.

**Key Highlights:**

- Data Scaling & Preprocessing

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and distribution visualization

- K-Means Clustering with Elbow Method to determine optimal cluster count

- 2D Scatter Plot visualizations of customer segments

- Interpretation of cluster profiles (high spenders, budget-conscious, etc.)

- Bonus: Experimented with alternative clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN) for comparison
-
