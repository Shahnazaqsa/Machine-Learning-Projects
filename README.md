#  Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Machine Learning Projects** built during my internship at *Elevvo Institute* and my personal learning journey.

Each task explores a different ML concept such as data preprocessing, regression, model evaluation, and experimentation — using real-world datasets and hands-on Python code.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning (missing values, object to numeric)
- Label Encoding
- Linear Regression & Polynomial Regression
- Model Evaluation (MAE, MSE, R² Score)
- Bonus: Feature engineering & performance comparison
